# speak-code

Repo set up for my pet project which is building a Conversation AI pair-programmer. The features are still in ideation phase, but:

1) It should be able to parse through an entire codebase, similar to gemini-cli, opencode, etc.
2) It should be able to receive commands by voice, initially meant to be a Q&A with your code.
3) Further on, you should be able to make code changes by voice commands.
4) FInally, the bot should converse with you on large features. It would list out the changes planned to implement said feature, and you would be able to stop it mid-way and insert new context, just like how you would at a conventional brainstorming session. 
5) The AI would also be able to counter your points or add to them and implement the changes.

This is something that I'm doing because I am bored with my day job and I want to stretch my arms out, and I'd love for people to contribute their own ideas or critique to further my thought process. 

Cheers! 

# To run the app
Run agent.py from inside the repo you want to try this on! (Will make it easier in the future)
